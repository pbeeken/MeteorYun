Connecting to Pi:
ssh pi@spaceghost.local
(keygen code and put it in the authorized_keys)

Copying files to Pi:
scp somefile.py pi@spaceghost.local:~/Documents

Serial connection is HardwareSerial on Arduino and '/dev/ttyACM0' on Pi.
Emulation using attached laptop is easy as commands are portable.

Some of the code examples were originally written for the Arduino Yun
running Python 2.7.  This was upgraded to the RaspberryPi which runs
Python 3.6.  Much more better.
