There are many possible programs to run on the Arduino we are trying to develop a kind of firmware
that allows control of the Arduino from python on the ATHOS linux supervisor. Since platformio, by
default, compiles and loads main.cpp as the entrypoint we create a hardlink to the firmware version
we wish to load through the following:

rm src/main.cpp  # delete existing link if defined.
ln firmware/<firmwarefile>.cpp src/main.cpp # create a link

What this means is that when we commit we get two copies of the existing file (the original firmware
code and the link).
